If you are moving from Tumblr to Octopress, you might have seen the Jekyll posts importer(https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations), but it doesn't quite work for Octopress. 

But there is a nice tutorial here(http://blog.assimov.net/blog/2012/03/24/tumblr-to-octopress-powered-by-jekyll-and-markdown/) which allows you to import your tumblr posts successfully. One problem I had was that, it doesn't import Githu Gists which is very annoying because I have too many gists in my blog posts. So I ahve patched the tumblr importer file and it works!

Please follow all the instructions from the link but just use the tumblr.rb file from this project.
